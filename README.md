# Django Bookstore Project

A simple Django-based web application that allows users to manage and explore a collection of books. This project was built as part of my Django learning journey to demonstrate CRUD operations, user authentication, and rating features in a real-world context.

  - Add new books with title, author, price, description, and cover image

  - Delete books from the store
  - View all books in a list with pagination
  - View individual book details
  
- **User Authentication**
  - User registration
  - User login/logout

  - Users can rate each book

- **Search and Filter
  - Search books by title or author
  - Filter books based on specific criteria
